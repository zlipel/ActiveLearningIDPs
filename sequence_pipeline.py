"""High-level orchestration of the active learning sequence pipeline.

This module documents the overall data flow for optimizing sequences:

1. Generate features for initial sequences using :mod:`al_pipeline.features`.
2. Collect simulation outputs and compile labels via :mod:`al_pipeline.labels`.
3. Train predictive models from :mod:`al_pipeline.models`.
4. Use genetic algorithms from :mod:`al_pipeline.selection` to propose new
   candidate sequences.
5. Evaluate candidates with EHVI and select the best sequence for the next
   iteration.

The implementation details are handled by the modules referenced above; this
file serves as a guide to how they interact in the optimization loop.
